# DBMS-miniproject
Miniproject that was submitted along with the report, as a part of the course, Database Management Systems(SEM IV).
The database is designed for a small to moderate school management system and includes all the files from different steps of the design procedure such as ER Diagram, relational schema etc.
This was a group project which I completed along with my classmates.
